This is a work in progress. An exploration of JS tools.

A simple todo app using local storage.

Using;

backbone,
underscore,
jquery,
require/almond
jasmine,
sinon,
jstestdriver (might not work with require)?
grunt,
grunt-require,
npm

Utils has a common interface which some more work with require.js relative paths within app.
